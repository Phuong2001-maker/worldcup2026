          European play-offs have repeatedly produced late winners, missed penalties and unexpected
          heroes. From icy November nights to packed summer stadiums, the margins have always been
          thin. This feature revisits five matches that still shape how fans talk about qualification.

          With 48 teams, confederations receive new slots and, in some cases, entirely new paths to
          the tournament. Coaches must navigate more competitive fixtures and make decisions about
          rotation, travel and fitness that were not necessary in previous cycles.

          Crossing three vast countries in a single trip requires planning. Supporters need to think
          about domestic flights, long‑distance trains, regional buses and car‑rental options.
          Basic research on visas, health insurance and mobile‑data plans can drastically reduce
          stress once the tournament begins.

          Teams may play in humid coastal cities one week and dry, high‑altitude venues the next.
          Sleep cycles, hydration strategies and recovery tools will all influence performance, and
          sports‑science departments will become crucial actors behind the scenes.

          Every World Cup promises long‑term benefits for local football communities. The reality is
          complicated: sometimes infrastructure ends up under‑used; sometimes it transforms
          participation. We examine previous tournaments to identify patterns that might emerge in
          2026.
