      <h1>About World Cup 2026</h1>
      <p>
        World Cup 2026 will be unlike any previous edition: more teams, more host cities and a
        larger geographical footprint than ever before. This page explains the big picture and
        clarifies what this website aims to do.

      <h2>Tournament overview</h2>
      <p>
        The tournament will take place across Canada, Mexico and the United States. Stadiums vary
        from football‑specific arenas to converted venues that normally host American football or
        large concerts. Because of the distances involved, travel planning is a serious factor for
        teams and supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Qualification processes are handled by the respective continental confederations. Each
        region decides how to allocate its slots, typically combining group stages and knock‑out
        play‑offs. The final tournament gathers the best teams from these processes for a
        concentrated month of football.

      <h2>What this website provides</h2>
      <p>
        This site is written for curious fans who enjoy understanding the structure around major
        tournaments: how fixtures are organised, how formats influence tactics and how host cities
        prepare for visitors. Instead of daily news updates, the focus lies on explanatory content
        that remains useful over time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Readable summaries of qualification paths and play‑off structures.</li>
        <li>Neutral commentary on tactical trends without favouring specific national teams.</li>
        <li>Basic travel and logistics considerations for supporters moving between cities.</li>
        <li>Context about stadiums, climate and scheduling constraints.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Editorial independence & disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        All text on this website is independently written for informational purposes. The site
        does not sell tickets, travel packages, broadcast rights or merchandise. Logos, brand
        names and official emblems of football organisations are not used here. Instead, simple
        geometric design elements hint at the tournament without copying protected artwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you make financial decisions – such as booking travel, buying tickets or applying
        for visas – you should rely on primary sources: official federations, governments and
        ticket providers. This site is best treated as an educational supplement.

      <h2>Technical design & performance goals</h2>
      <p>
        From a technical point of view the website is built with lightweight, semantic HTML, a
        single optimised CSS file and a compact JavaScript bundle. This keeps page‑load times low
        and helps search engines understand the structure of the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The layout adapts to mobile phones, tablets and desktop screens without relying on heavy
        frameworks. Accessibility features – such as proper landmarks, alt attributes and keyboard
        navigation for the tabbed match‑centre interface – are prioritised from the beginning.
